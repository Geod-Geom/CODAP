## About the project

Important note

The application is in its beta version. You may have to enable popups for this website to be able to register and login.

## Welcome!

The Statistics Canada pilot project expects to map the Ottawa-Gatineau region's buildings to fill the gaps in existing data and provide new analytical opportunities for data users. 
In order to invite everyone to collaborate, it has been chosen to use the OpenStreetMap open source platform.
This project is inspired by the Statistics Canada project, extending the mapping to land uses of the areas. In detail, the purpose of this work is to collect data on abandoned buildings and areas. The pilot project will focus on Tor Sapienza district in Rome by virtue of extended disused building stock. Currently, the available data are not sufficient to analyse the features and potentiality of spaces fallen into disuse. 
The information entered or modified through the web application will be used to outline an urban regeneration project according to sustainability criteria and the reuse of buildings and abandoned areas.


## Getting started

The first thing you can do if you are new to OpenStreetMap is to go to the: Beginner's guide. You will need to register to OpenStreetMap to be able to contribute. The guide explains how. You can start mapping and when you save your changes, you will have to authenticate.
The rest is simple: zoom in and explore the map. You can switch from a topographic map to a satellite imagery base. Click on buildings you know and enter information about them in the form on the left. You can also add new points to add businesses, shops and services like a post office. Look carefully to make sure that the information is not already there.
